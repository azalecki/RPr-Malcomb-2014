## Abstract

The original study is a multi-criteria analysis of vulnerability to Climate Change in Malawi, and is one of the earliest sub-national geographic models of climate change vulnerability for an African country. The study aims to be replicable, and had 40 citations in Google Scholar as of April 8, 2021.

## Original Study Information

The study region is the country of Malawi. The spatial support of input data includes DHS survey points, Traditional Authority boundaries, and raster grids of flood risk (0.833 degree resolution) and drought exposure (0.416 degree resolution).

The original study was published without data or code, but has detailed narrative description of the methodology. The methods used are feasible for undergraduate students to implement following completion of one introductory GIS course. The study states that its data is available for replication in 23 African countries.


### Data Description and Variables

Outline the data used in the study, including:

- sources of each data layer and
- the variable(s) used from each data source
- transformations applied to the variables (e.g. rescaling variables, calculating derived variables, aggregating to different geographic units, etc.)

This part may be compiled collaboratively as a group!

### Analytical Specification

The original study was conducted using ArcGIS and STATA, but does not state which versions of these software were used.
The replication study will use R.

## Materials and Procedure

*ADAPTIVE CAPACITY WORKFLOW [ASSETS & ACCESS]*
Should we join LHZ data to village points much earlier on in the analysis?

1. Bring in DHS Data [Households Level] (vector)
2. Bring in TA (Traditional Authority boundaries) and LHZ (livelihood zones) data
3. Get rid of unsuitable households (eliminate NULL and/or missing values)
3. Join TA and LHZ ID data to the DHS clusters
4. Pre-process the livestock data
	Filter for NA livestock data
	Update livestock data (summing different kinds)
5. FIELD CALCULATOR: Normalize each indicator variable and rescale from 1-5 (real numbers) based on percent rank
6. FIELD CALCULATOR / ADD FIELD: Apply weights to normalized indicator variables to get scores for each category (assets, access)
7. SUMMARIZE/AGGREGATE: find the stats of the capacity of each TA (min, max, mean, sd)
8. Join ta_capacity to TA based on ta_id
	(Multiply by 20--meaningless??) I have a question about this (so do I) ln.216
9. Prepare breaks for mapping
Class intervals based on capacity_2010 field
Take the values and round them to 2 decimal places
Put data in 4 classes based on break values
10. Save the adaptive capacity scores

11. Load in UNEP raster
Set CRS for drought
Set CRS for flood
12.  Clean and reproject rasters
Create a bounding box at extent of Malawi Where does this info come from
Add geometry info and precision (st_as_sfc)
For Drought: use bilinear to avg continuous population exposure values
For Flood: use nearest neighbor to preserve integer values
13. CLIP the traditional authorities with the LHZs to cut out the lake
14. RASTERIZE the ta_capacity data with pixel data corresponding to capacity_2010 field
15. RASTER CALCULATOR:
Create a mask
Reclassify the flood layer (quintiles, currently binary)
Reclassify the drought values (quantile [from 0 - 1 in intervals of 0.2 =5])
Add component rasters for final weighted score of drought + flood
16. AGGREGATE: Create final vulnerability layer using envi. vulnerability score and ta_capacity I’m a little confused about how exactly this happens, but seems to be averaging the ta_final (which corresponds to vulnerability) and ta_2010 columns

Also, where does LHZ enter into this final value?



## Replication Results

For each output from the original study (mainly figure 4 and figure 5), present separately the results of the replication attempt.

2.	State whether the original study was or was not supported by the replication
3.	State whether any hypothesis linked to a planned deviation from the original study was supported. Provide key statistics and related reasoning.

Figures to Include:
- map of resilience by traditional authority in 2010, analagous to figure 4 of the original study
- map of vulnerability in Malawi, analagous to figure 5 of the original study
- map of difference between your figure 4 and the original figure 4
- map of difference between your figure 5 and the original figure 5

## Unplanned Deviations from the Protocol

Summarize changes and uncertainties between
- your interpretation and plan for the workflow based on reading the paper
- your final workflow after accessing the data and code and completing the code

## Discussion

Provide a summary and interpretation of the key findings of the replication *vis-a-vis* the original study results. If the attempt was a failure, discuss possible causes of the failure. In this replication, any failure is probably due to practical causes, which may include:
- lack of data
- lack of code
- lack of details in the original analysis
- uncertainties due to manner in which data has been used

## Conclusion

Restate the key findings and discuss their broader societal implications or contributions to theory.
Do the research findings suggest a need for any future research?
